In this project, I built a  Google Data Studio based on this data_set visualizing the following:
By channel, impressions and clicks
By date, cost and clicks
Sub channel by cost comparison
A chart using one or more of the calculated metric showing 
Cost per lead_complete (cost / lead_complete)
CPC (cost / click)
CTR (clicks  / impressions)
Conversion Rate (lead_complete / clicks)
I have also attached a document highlighting issues in the data.
